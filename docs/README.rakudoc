Checks and reports details of the Git status of all directories 
under directory 'dir' which are 'dirty' (i.e, having a non-zero
C<Git::Status>).

(Note <dir> must be the first argument entered.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The installed program will be very useful for any user who has to maintain many 
Git repositories, especially when the user has to keep those same repositories
synchronized on multiple hosts.

=head1 CREDITS

A big tip of my hat to prolific Raku module author and major core developer, 
Elizabeth Mattijsen (AKA @lizmat) 
for her very useful C<Git::Status> module which this module
depends upon.
