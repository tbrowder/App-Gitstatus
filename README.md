NAME
====

**App::Gitstatus** - Provides an installed program, `git-status-check`, to help maintain a directory of Git repositories

SYNOPSIS
========

Execute `git-status-check` without arguments to see its capabilities:

```raku
$ git-status-check # OUTPUT:
Usage: git-status-check <dir> [...options...]

Checks the Git status of all directories under
directory 'dir' which are 'dirty' (i.e., having
a non-zero 'Git::Status') and lists those
directories.

Options:
  all        - report details of all dirty directories
  first      - report the first directory only
  last       - report the last directory only
  ignore=/X/ - ignore directory names satisfying regex /X/
  select=/X/ - select directory names satisfying regex /X/
  debug
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The installed program will be very useful for any user who has to maintain many Git repositories, especially when the user has to keep those same repositories synchronized on multiple hosts.

CREDITS
=======

A big tip of my hat to prolific Raku module author and major core developer, Elizabeth Mattijsen (AKA @lizmat) for her very useful `Git::Status` module which this module depends upon.
